## Project description:

- The goal of this application is to fetch and display the weather for a city or a list of cities using the [OpenWeatherApp API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
- The app will display the current weather as well as the weather forecast for the next five days.

## Getting Started:

- Download file `city.list.min.json` from http://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/ and place it in your `Documents` folder. This file contains an array of City JSON objects with properties such as a city id, name, state, country and coordinates.
- Run the application. The data will be loaded at the beginning.
- Let the menu guide you

## Features:

- Search for a city by name, using "autocompletion"
- Get the current weather conditions for a city or a list of cities
- Get 5 day weather forecast a city

## API:

  - Current weather data (https://openweathermap.org/current)
  - Call 5 day / 3 hour forecast data (https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)
